LOG is the file extension for an automatically produced file that contains a record of events from certain software and operating systems.
While they can contain a number of things, log files are often used to show all events associated with the system or application that created them.
For example, your backup program might keep log files showing exactly what happened (or didn't happen) during a backup. Windows keeps all kinds of log files for its various services.
